* Create a sequential implementian for sequneces (use lists)
* Streamline the implementation of the span by returning the total as the last element of the sequence.  this should help get rid of the even/odd division edge case.
* Create a simple parallel implementation for sequences (no granularity)
* Update the ML primer notes
