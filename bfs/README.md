# BFS

This directory contains several implementations of the BFS, including
sequential and several parallel implementations.

The sequential implementation is standard.
The parallel implementations follow the presentation
[in this chapter](https://diderot.one/courses/121/books/494/chapter/6873)
of the Acar-Blelloch algorithms book.

The graph representation is a sequence-based representation 
[as described here](https://diderot.one/courses/121/books/494/chapter/6871)


The implementation follows the description presented
